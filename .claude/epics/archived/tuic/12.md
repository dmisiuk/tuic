# Task: Visual Testing

## Description
Develop custom visual testing utilities for screenshot capture, regression testing, and automated demo generation. Create infrastructure for visual consistency validation across builds and platforms with comprehensive demo library creation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Screenshot capture utilities for terminal applications
- [ ] Visual regression testing comparing builds
- [ ] Automated demo generation for all calculator operations
- [ ] Cross-platform visual comparison tools
- [ ] Demo library covering all features and interactions
- [ ] Integration with CI/CD for automated visual validation
- [ ] Before/after screenshot comparison for PRs
- [ ] Error state visual documentation
- [ ] Performance benchmarks for visual operations

## Technical Details
- Create testing utilities in `internal/testing/visual/`
- Screenshot capture: `capture.go` with terminal screen capture
- Comparison engine: `compare.go` for image diffing
- Demo generator: `demo.go` for automated demonstrations
- Test fixtures: `fixtures/` with baseline images
- Platform-specific adaptations for terminal differences
- Integration with existing test suite
- Key files: visual utilities, comparison engine, demo automation

## Dependencies
- [ ] Button Grid UI completed for visual elements (003)
- [ ] Basic UI rendering functional
- [ ] Terminal capture capabilities researched

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 16-20 hours
- Parallel: true (can develop alongside other UI components)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Screenshot capture working on all platforms
- [ ] Visual regression detection functional
- [ ] Automated demo generation complete
- [ ] Integration with test suite successful
- [ ] CI/CD visual validation pipeline established
- [ ] Comprehensive demo library created
- [ ] Zero visual regression tolerance achieved
- [ ] Documentation for visual testing process
