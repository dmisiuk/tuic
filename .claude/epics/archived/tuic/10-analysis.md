# Parallel Work Analysis: Issue #10

## Overview
Implement comprehensive input handling for the calculator TUI, including keyboard navigation, mouse interaction, and focus management. This system will enable seamless user interaction through multiple input modalities with proper event routing and state management.

## Parallel Streams

### Stream A: Keyboard Handler
**Scope**: Direct key input, operator handling, navigation keys, and shortcuts
**Files**:
- `internal/ui/input/keyboard.go` - Core keyboard event handling
- `internal/ui/input/keybindings.go` - Key mapping and configuration
- `internal/ui/input/shortcuts.go` - Keyboard shortcuts and hotkeys
**Agent Type**: frontend-specialist
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 5-6 hours
**Dependencies**: TUI Foundation completed

### Stream B: Mouse Handler
**Scope**: Mouse click detection, hover states, and wheel scrolling
**Files**:
- `internal/ui/input/mouse.go` - Mouse event processing
- `internal/ui/input/hover.go` - Hover state management
- `internal/ui/input/click_detection.go` - Button hit testing
**Agent Type**: frontend-specialist
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 4-5 hours
**Dependencies**: TUI Foundation completed

### Stream C: Focus Management
**Scope**: Focus tracking, navigation, and visual feedback
**Files**:
- `internal/ui/input/focus.go` - Focus state management
- `internal/ui/input/navigation.go` - Tab/arrow key navigation
- `internal/ui/input/visual_feedback.go` - Focus indication
**Agent Type**: frontend-specialist
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 4-5 hours
**Dependencies**: TUI Foundation completed

### Stream D: Event Router & Integration
**Scope**: Event routing, input validation, and system integration
**Files**:
- `internal/ui/input/events.go` - Event routing and dispatch
- `internal/ui/input/validation.go` - Input validation and sanitization
- `internal/ui/input/integration.go` - Integration with UI model
- `internal/ui/input/input_test.go` - Comprehensive testing
**Agent Type**: integration-specialist
**Can Start**: after Streams A, B, C have interfaces defined
**Estimated Hours**: 3-4 hours
**Dependencies**: Streams A, B, C interfaces

## Coordination Points

### Shared Files
**Project Configuration**:
- `internal/ui/model.go` - Integration point for all input handlers
- `internal/ui/update.go` - Message routing updates needed
- `internal/ui/input/input.go` - Main input package interface

### Interface Contracts
**Critical coordination needed**:
1. **Keyboard Interface** (Stream A): Define `KeyHandler` interface and event types
2. **Mouse Interface** (Stream B): Define `MouseHandler` interface and click detection
3. **Focus Interface** (Stream C): Define `FocusManager` interface and navigation methods
4. **Event System** (Stream D): Define unified event routing contract
5. **Integration Points**: Agree on how each handler integrates with the Bubble Tea model

### Sequential Requirements
**Order dependencies**:
1. Handler interfaces before implementations
2. Focus management before keyboard navigation logic
3. Event routing contract before handler implementations
4. Integration layer after all handlers are complete
5. Testing after stable interfaces exist

## Conflict Risk Assessment
**Medium Risk**: Multiple handlers interacting with shared UI state
- All streams modify the same model state
- Focus management affects both keyboard and mouse handling
- Event routing must coordinate between different input types

**Coordination Required**:
- Focus state sharing between keyboard and mouse handlers
- Event priority ordering (keyboard vs mouse conflicts)
- Integration with existing Bubble Tea message system
- Testing coordination for cross-handler interactions

## Parallelization Strategy

**Recommended Approach**: Interface-First Parallel

**Phase 1 (Interface Definition)**: All streams work together to define interfaces
- 2-hour collaborative session to define all interfaces
- Stream A: Define keyboard event types and handler interface
- Stream B: Define mouse event types and detection interface
- Stream C: Define focus management and navigation interface
- Stream D: Define event routing and validation interface

**Phase 2 (Parallel Implementation)**: Simultaneous implementation
- Streams A, B, C implement their handlers independently
- Stream D prepares integration layer and testing framework
- Weekly sync sessions to resolve interface mismatches

**Phase 3 (Integration & Testing)**:
- Stream D integrates all handlers and validates event routing
- Comprehensive cross-handler testing
- Performance optimization and conflict resolution

## Expected Timeline

**With parallel execution**:
- **Phase 1**: 2 hours (interface definition)
- **Phase 2**: 5 hours (parallel implementation - max of streams)
- **Phase 3**: 4 hours (integration + testing)
- **Wall time**: 11 hours
- **Total work**: 16 hours
- **Efficiency gain**: 31%

**Without parallel execution**:
- **Wall time**: 16 hours (sequential completion)

## Implementation Strategy

### Hour 0-2: Interface Definition Phase
**All Streams**: Collaborative interface design
- Define `InputEvent` interface for all input types
- Define `KeyHandler`, `MouseHandler`, `FocusManager` interfaces
- Define event routing contracts and message types
- Agree on focus state management approach

### Hour 2-7: Parallel Implementation Phase
**Stream A**: Implement keyboard handler
- Direct key input (0-9, operators, Enter)
- Navigation key handling (arrows, Tab, Shift+Tab)
- Keyboard shortcuts and hotkeys
- Key binding configuration system

**Stream B**: Implement mouse handler
- Click detection and hit testing
- Hover state management
- Mouse wheel scrolling
- Button press/release handling

**Stream C**: Implement focus management
- Focus state tracking and transitions
- Visual feedback for focused elements
- Navigation logic (grid, list, custom)
- Focus memory and restoration

**Stream D**: Prepare integration layer
- Event routing system
- Input validation framework
- Test infrastructure setup
- Integration with existing UI model

### Hour 7-11: Integration & Testing Phase
**Stream D**: Lead integration effort
- Combine all handlers into unified input system
- Resolve event conflicts and priority issues
- Implement comprehensive testing suite
- Performance optimization and validation

## Notes
- **Critical Success Factor**: Early interface agreement prevents major refactoring
- **Bubble Tea Integration**: Must work seamlessly with existing MVU pattern
- **Performance**: <100ms response time requirement for all input events
- **Cross-Platform**: Ensure consistent behavior across different terminals
- **Accessibility**: Support keyboard-only navigation and screen readers

## Risk Mitigation
- **Interface Changes**: Use interface-first approach with Go's implicit interfaces
- **Event Conflicts**: Define clear priority rules (keyboard > mouse by default)
- **Focus Bugs**: Implement focus state validation and debugging tools
- **Performance**: Profile input handling early and optimize bottlenecks
- **Testing**: Create integration tests that validate cross-handler interactions
- **Platform Issues**: Test on multiple terminal emulators early and often

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Individual handler testing (90%+ coverage)
- **Integration Tests**: Cross-handler interaction validation
- **Performance Tests**: Input response time validation
- **Accessibility Tests**: Keyboard-only navigation validation
- **Platform Tests**: Cross-terminal compatibility verification
