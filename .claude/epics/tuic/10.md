# Task: Input System

## Description
Implement comprehensive input handling supporting both keyboard and mouse interactions. Include direct number key input, navigation with arrow keys and Tab, mouse click handling, and focus management with proper event routing.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Direct number key input (0-9) regardless of focus
- [ ] Operator key handling (+, -, *, /) for operations
- [ ] Enter key for equals operation
- [ ] Tab/Shift+Tab cycling through button grid
- [ ] Arrow key navigation with wraparound
- [ ] Space for button activation when focused
- [ ] Mouse click detection on buttons
- [ ] Mouse hover states and focus indication
- [ ] Proper event routing to calculator engine
- [ ] Input validation and error handling

## Technical Details
- Create input handlers in `internal/ui/input/`
- Keyboard handler: `keyboard.go` with key mapping
- Mouse handler: `mouse.go` with click detection
- Focus manager: `focus.go` for navigation state
- Event router: `events.go` for dispatching actions
- Integration with button grid for visual feedback
- Input validation before sending to calculator engine
- Key files: input handlers, focus management, event routing

## Dependencies
- [ ] TUI Foundation completed (002)
- [ ] Button grid structure available (can develop in parallel with 003)
- [ ] Calculator engine interface defined

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 14-18 hours
- Parallel: false (requires TUI foundation)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All keyboard inputs properly handled
- [ ] Mouse interaction fully functional
- [ ] Focus navigation works smoothly
- [ ] Input validation prevents invalid states
- [ ] Integration tests for all input methods
- [ ] Performance test for input responsiveness
- [ ] Cross-platform input compatibility verified
- [ ] Meets < 100ms input response requirement
