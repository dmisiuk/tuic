# Task: Audio Integration

## Description
Integrate cross-platform audio feedback using the Beep library with distinct sound profiles for different button types. Implement graceful degradation when audio is unavailable and ensure no hard dependencies on audio functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Beep library integrated for cross-platform audio
- [ ] Distinct sounds for number buttons, operator buttons, and special buttons
- [ ] Button press sound feedback with appropriate timing
- [ ] Error notification sounds for invalid operations
- [ ] Graceful degradation when audio hardware unavailable
- [ ] Audio settings configurable (on/off)
- [ ] No blocking or performance impact when audio fails
- [ ] Cross-platform audio compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## Technical Details
- Create audio service in `internal/audio/service.go`
- Sound profiles in `internal/audio/sounds.go`
- Audio configuration in `internal/audio/config.go`
- Integration with button press events from input system
- Error handling for missing audio hardware
- Optional audio initialization with fallback
- Sound generation or embedded audio files
- Key files: audio service, sound management, configuration

## Dependencies
- [ ] Calculator engine completed for error event types (001)
- [ ] Input system for button press events (004)
- [ ] Beep library dependency added to project

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 10-12 hours
- Parallel: false (requires input system for events)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Audio feedback working on all target platforms
- [ ] Distinct sounds implemented for all button types
- [ ] Graceful fallback when audio unavailable
- [ ] No performance impact on calculator operations
- [ ] Audio can be disabled without affecting functionality
- [ ] Integration tests with audio mocking
- [ ] Cross-platform audio testing completed
- [ ] Audio timing meets user experience requirements
