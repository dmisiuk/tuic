# Task: End-to-End Testing

## Description
Implement comprehensive end-to-end testing covering complete user workflows from application launch to calculation completion. Include testing for both keyboard and mouse interaction paths, error scenarios, and performance validation across all platforms.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Full user workflow tests (launch to calculation completion)
- [ ] Keyboard-only interaction path testing
- [ ] Mouse-only interaction path testing
- [ ] Mixed input method testing
- [ ] Error scenario coverage (division by zero, overflow, invalid input)
- [ ] Performance validation (startup time, input response)
- [ ] Cross-platform E2E test execution
- [ ] Terminal compatibility testing across major emulators
- [ ] Memory usage validation during extended use
- [ ] Graceful shutdown and cleanup testing

## Technical Details
- Create E2E test suite in `test/e2e/`
- Test scenarios in `test/e2e/scenarios/`
- Platform-specific test runners
- Integration with CI/CD for automated E2E execution
- Performance measurement and validation
- Error injection and recovery testing
- Terminal emulator compatibility matrix
- Key files: E2E test framework, scenario definitions, performance tests

## Dependencies
- [ ] Button Grid UI functional (003)
- [ ] Input System completed (004)
- [ ] Audio Integration working (005)
- [ ] Basic application fully functional

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 14-18 hours
- Parallel: false (requires completed UI and input systems)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Complete E2E test suite implemented
- [ ] All user workflows covered with tests
- [ ] Error scenarios properly tested
- [ ] Performance requirements validated
- [ ] Cross-platform testing successful
- [ ] CI/CD integration complete
- [ ] Test coverage meets quality gates
- [ ] Terminal compatibility verified across major emulators
