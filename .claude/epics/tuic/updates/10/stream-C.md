## Completed
- None

## Working On
- Creating focus.go - Focus state management interface and core implementation

## Blocked
- None

## Notes
- Keyboard handler (Stream A) is completed with navigation interface ready
- Mouse handler (Stream B) is completed with click detection ready
- Focus management needs to integrate with both handlers
- Button grid structure not yet implemented - will need to define focusable elements

## Interface Requirements
Based on existing keyboard handler, focus management must support:
- Grid navigation (up, down, left, right)
- Tab/Shift+Tab cycling
- Focus activation with space
- Visual feedback for focused state
- Focus memory and restoration
