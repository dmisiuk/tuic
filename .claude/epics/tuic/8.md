# Task: TUI Foundation

## Description
Set up the foundational Bubble Tea application structure with basic rendering, state management, and the Model-View-Update (MVU) pattern. This establishes the core TUI framework that all UI components will build upon.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Bubble Tea application initialized with proper MVU structure
- [ ] Basic terminal UI rendering with clean layout
- [ ] State management structure defined for calculator state
- [ ] Application startup and shutdown handling
- [ ] Terminal size detection and responsive layout
- [ ] Basic keyboard input handling framework
- [ ] Error handling for terminal compatibility issues
- [ ] Graceful fallback for unsupported terminal features

## Technical Details
- Create main application in `cmd/tuic/main.go`
- Implement core model in `internal/ui/model.go`
- Set up basic view rendering in `internal/ui/view.go`
- Update handler in `internal/ui/update.go`
- Terminal utility functions in `internal/ui/terminal.go`
- Integration with calculator engine for state updates
- Key dependencies: Bubble Tea framework initialization

## Dependencies
- [ ] Go modules setup with Bubble Tea dependency
- [ ] Basic project structure established
- [ ] Calculator engine interface defined (can develop in parallel)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 10-14 hours
- Parallel: true (can develop alongside calculator engine)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Bubble Tea app runs without errors
- [ ] Basic terminal rendering functional
- [ ] State management pattern established
- [ ] Integration tests for app lifecycle
- [ ] Compatible with major terminal emulators
- [ ] Code follows Bubble Tea best practices
