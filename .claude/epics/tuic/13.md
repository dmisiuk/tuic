# Task: Cross-Platform Build

## Description
Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline with cross-compilation for Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms. Implement automated building, testing, and release artifact generation with single binary deployment for each platform.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD
- [ ] Cross-compilation for Windows (.exe), macOS, and Linux
- [ ] Automated testing on all target platforms
- [ ] Single binary output with no external dependencies
- [ ] Release automation with artifact publishing
- [ ] Binary size validation (< 5MB per platform)
- [ ] Performance benchmarking in CI pipeline
- [ ] Automated dependency vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Build matrix testing across Go versions

## Technical Details
- Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for continuous integration
- Create `.github/workflows/release.yml` for release automation
- Cross-compilation using Go's built-in capabilities
- Artifact collection and publishing to GitHub Releases
- Platform-specific testing and validation
- Binary optimization and size monitoring
- Integration with visual testing pipeline
- Key files: GitHub Actions workflows, build scripts, release configuration

## Dependencies
- [ ] Calculator engine basic functionality (001)
- [ ] TUI foundation for buildable application (002)
- [ ] Go modules properly configured

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 12-14 hours
- Parallel: true (can set up alongside core development)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline running successfully
- [ ] Cross-platform builds generating correctly
- [ ] All tests passing on target platforms
- [ ] Binary size requirements met
- [ ] Release automation functional
- [ ] Performance benchmarks integrated
- [ ] Security scanning operational
- [ ] Documentation for build and release process
