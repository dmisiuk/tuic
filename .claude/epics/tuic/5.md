# Task: Calculator Engine

## Description
Implement the core calculator engine with basic arithmetic operations, expression parsing, and robust error handling. This forms the foundation for all calculator functionality with proper operator precedence and floating-point precision handling.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- [ ] Proper operator precedence handling
- [ ] Floating-point number support with appropriate precision
- [ ] Division by zero error handling
- [ ] Overflow/underflow detection and handling
- [ ] Expression parsing and evaluation
- [ ] Clear (C) and Clear Entry (CE) functionality
- [ ] 90%+ test coverage for all calculator logic

## Technical Details
- Create `internal/calculator` package for core logic
- Implement expression parser using recursive descent or similar
- Use Go's built-in float64 for calculations with precision validation
- Error types for different calculation errors (division by zero, overflow, invalid expression)
- Stateless design for easy testing and thread safety
- Key files: `internal/calculator/engine.go`, `internal/calculator/parser.go`, `internal/calculator/errors.go`

## Dependencies
- [ ] Go 1.19+ environment setup
- [ ] Project structure initialization
- [ ] Basic module configuration (go.mod)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 12-16 hours
- Parallel: true (independent of UI components)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with proper error handling
- [ ] Comprehensive unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Benchmarks for performance validation
- [ ] Documentation with usage examples
- [ ] Code follows Go best practices and conventions
