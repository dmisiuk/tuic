# Project Brief

## What This Project Does
The CCPM Demo Project serves as a comprehensive demonstration and validation environment for the Claude Code Project Management (CCPM) system. It showcases how modern software development teams can integrate AI-powered project management directly into their development workflow, eliminating context switching and reducing manual overhead.

## Why This Project Exists

### Primary Purpose
- **Demonstrate CCPM Capabilities**: Provide a working example of CCPM system features
- **Validate Workflow Integration**: Prove that PM tasks can be seamlessly integrated into development
- **Educational Resource**: Serve as a learning tool for teams adopting CCPM
- **Testing Ground**: Environment for testing and refining CCPM features

### Problem Statement
Modern software development suffers from fragmented project management where developers must constantly switch between development tools and PM platforms. This context switching reduces productivity, leads to outdated documentation, and creates friction in the development process.

### Solution Approach
CCPM embeds project management directly into the development environment through:
- **AI Integration**: Context-aware AI assistants that understand project state
- **Automation**: Automated status reporting, documentation generation, and workflow management
- **Git Integration**: PM processes that work naturally with git-based development
- **Command Interface**: Simple slash commands for all PM operations

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- **Complete CCPM Implementation**: Full PM system with all core features
- **Demonstration Workflows**: End-to-end examples of typical development scenarios
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation of features and workflows
- **Integration Examples**: GitHub, git, and Claude Code integration patterns
- **Automation Scripts**: Complete suite of PM automation tools

### Out of Scope
- **Production Application**: This is a demo, not a production application
- **Custom PM Features**: Focus on core CCPM features, not custom extensions
- **Performance Optimization**: Demo-quality performance is sufficient
- **Enterprise Features**: Focus on core team workflows, not enterprise-scale features

## Key Objectives

### Immediate Goals (Current Sprint)
1. **System Initialization**: Complete CCPM setup and configuration
2. **Context Establishment**: Create comprehensive project context documentation
3. **Basic Workflow**: Demonstrate core PM commands and workflows
4. **Documentation**: Document all features and usage patterns

### Short-term Goals (Next 1-2 Sprints)
1. **Feature Demonstration**: Show all major CCPM features in action
2. **Workflow Optimization**: Refine and optimize demonstrated workflows
3. **Integration Testing**: Validate all system integrations work correctly
4. **User Experience**: Ensure smooth developer experience

### Long-term Goals (Next 3-6 Months)
1. **Feedback Integration**: Incorporate user feedback from demo usage
2. **Feature Extensions**: Add new features based on real-world usage
3. **Performance Improvement**: Optimize system performance and reliability
4. **Ecosystem Growth**: Expand integrations and capabilities

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success
- **Complete Feature Set**: All core CCPM features working correctly
- **Smooth Integration**: Seamless integration with git, GitHub, and Claude Code
- **Reliable Automation**: All automation scripts work consistently
- **Accurate Context**: Context system maintains current, accurate project state

### User Experience Success
- **Easy Adoption**: New users can quickly understand and use the system
- **Intuitive Workflow**: PM tasks feel natural within development workflow
- **Time Savings**: Measurable reduction in manual PM overhead
- **Developer Satisfaction**: Positive feedback from demo users

### Business Success
- **Validation**: Prove CCPM concept works in practice
- **Adoption**: Evidence that teams would adopt this approach
- **Scalability**: Demonstrate system works for different team sizes and project types
- **ROI**: Clear value proposition for organizations

## Project Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- **Platform**: macOS/Linux development environments
- **Dependencies**: GitHub CLI, git, bash shell environment
- **Integration**: Must work within Claude Code ecosystem

### Resource Constraints
- **Timeline**: Demo must be functional quickly
- **Scope**: Focus on core features, not comprehensive PM platform
- **Complexity**: Keep examples realistic but not overly complex

### Quality Constraints
- **Reliability**: Demo must work consistently for presentations
- **Documentation**: All features must be well documented
- **Maintainability**: System must be easy to maintain and extend
